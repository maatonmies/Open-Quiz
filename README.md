# Open Quiz
Open Quiz is a dynamic quiz application developed in ASP.NET Webforms. The quiz questions are obtained from the Open Trivia Database using server side calls to their public Web API. Json response is deserialized into a C# object to populate classic Web Form Controls that are also exposed to client side Javascript for visual feedback and progress.
